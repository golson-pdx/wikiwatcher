APP.PY ENDPOINTS:
As an individual curious about a topic, I want to be able to query the API for an article's revision history.

As an individual curious about a user, I want to be able to query the API for a user's revision history.

As an individual curious about the past state of an article, I want to query the API for the article's contents at that point in the past.

As an indivudual interested in how understandings and attitudes have shifted over time, I want to query the API for the difference between an article across two points in time.

REVISION CLASS STRUCTURE/DATA MEMBERS:
As a curious individual, I want the program to store and display information about a particular revision to an article I'm interested in.
{user passes in an article title, fromdatetime, and todatetime. API gets two revisions and compares them - use RevisionHistory and return wikimedia.compare([0], [-1])}

REVISIONHISTORY CLASS:
• Queries for history of edits to an article, with filters for:
◇time period
	As a historian, I want to compare the oldest version of an article to a newer version so that I can track cultural changes over time.

◇ keyword
	As a celebrity's PR manager, I want to track when/how frequently a certain keyword has been included in edits for my client's page so that I can guide them on how to handle a controversy involving that keyword.

◇ type of edit (vandalism, punctuation, etc.)
	As a developer of an application that utilizes this API, I want to get data about vandalism-edits across all of Wikipedia, so that I can build a website that visualizes the most vandalized articles.
	As a domain expert, I want to search through reversions so that I can see how often false information is being spread about this topic.

◇ Queries for the version of an article that was live at any given datetime, or the diff between two versions of an article at any two datetimes.
	As a historian interested in using Wikipedia as a metric for cultural shifts, I want to examine articles at different points in time and compare one version of an article to another arbitrarily.

USERHISTORY CLASS:
• Queries for history of edits by a user, with filters for:
◇ time period
	As a wikipedia developer, I want to check how frequently a user has made edits over a recent time period so that I can mark their user page as having a certain activity level.

◇ keyword
	As a wikipedia moderator, I want to search a user's edits for a problematic keyword so that I can limit their account in the case that they're a detriment to the site/community.
